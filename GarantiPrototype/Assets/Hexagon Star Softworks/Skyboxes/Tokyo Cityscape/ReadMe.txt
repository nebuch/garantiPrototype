Skybox Tips & Tricks
--------------------
- Make sure that the Wrap Mode of skybox images is set to Clamp!

- Make sure that the Max Size of skybox images is set high enough! (You want to set it to 2048 for the 2048 resolution images in case they aren't!)

- Keep the horizon of your image centered on the horizon line (which is in the vertical center). Otherwise the skybox will end up looking wrong when rendered in-game.

- When resizing the skybox image Photoshop is trying to interpolate the edges of the blue sky areas which results in dirty edges being added. To prevent this you can duplicate the outer edge of each sky layer that borders on the black background two or three times and shift the duplicates into the black area to prevent the interpolated edges from being inside the used sky area.
